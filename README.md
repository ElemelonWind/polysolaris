# Polysolaris 🪐

After binge reading the Three Body Problem, I decided to code a quick simulation of an n-body system. This is entirely not to scale, but I played with the numbers until it worked with reasonable ranges - to see decent results try:

- double/triple digit masses
- distances between bodies around 50-150
- single digit initial velocities

Simulation coded using React.js and Euler's formula.
